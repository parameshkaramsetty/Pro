Procedural Language

Pointer - a pointer is used to access something outside of a program
        - to access external resources like harddisk , keyboard
        - to access memory in heap
        It is used to store the address to locate and access it
        It is also used for parameter passing

Data Variable is used to store data
int a

Address variable is used to store address - Pointer
int* p or int *p // declaration
p = &a -> store the address of Data Variable a //assignment or initialization
printf("%d",*p) // dereferencing


Whenever something is declared it will be inside stack

To get Memory in Heap - we need to use the function malloc
#include<stdlib.h>
malloc - takes the size and it should be mentioned
       - returns void pointer
int *p ;
p = (int*) malloc(n*sizeof(int)) - let the compiler decide the size
since it returns a void pointer we need to typecast it into integer pointer
This is how Memory in Heap is created

C++:
int *p;
p = new int[5]; // creates memory in heap
