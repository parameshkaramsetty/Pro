'''

we use for loop when we know how many number iterations does the loop need to perform

works based on a sequence - we use for loop when we want to refer to a sequence

here we do not increment / decrement values - it goes one by one - unlike while loop

used with sequences , strings

we can access elements :

for i in sequence:  
    print(i)





'''
# for i in range(1,11): -> we can also use range in certain operations
#     print(i,end=" ")

# range() -> we can use this in for loops 
#### in descending order we need to give step count (-1)

# for i in s: # here we can mention sequence in place of s
#     print(i)


# once if we use for loop - we can do anything in it

# like conditionals and so on
