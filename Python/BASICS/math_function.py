# we need to import modules and then we need to work with its functions
import math 
x=25
print(math.sqrt(x))
print(math.floor(23.425))#floor it will give 23
print(math.ceil(23.425))#ceil it will give 24
#like wise we can do functions related to mathematics
#it is better to use functions in projects
print(math.pi)
print(math.e)
#inorder to use alias name of the module use alias (as) -> to give another name to module only to purpose
#import math as m
# we can also import required functions also
#from math import sqrt , pow

#inorder to get availabe functions we need to press "ctrl + space " -> by this we can get all the functions available in the module
