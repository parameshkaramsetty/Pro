# break -> to jump of the loop - we use this - to break the loop we use this
# continue -> to skip the values in a sequence - we use this  - skip and go back to the next iteration
# pass -> used when we ignore the block of code or suite in python - when there is no code and we can ignore it
# just pass the block -> in c/c++ -> we can use {} - does not make any sense

break

availabel_candies = 10
needed = 12
i=0
while(i<=needed):
    if i>availabel_candies: -> here we break the loop when i is > available

'''
continue

we skip the i when i%3==0

for i in range(1,101):
    if i%3==0: -> it skips the i that are divisible by 3
        continue
    print(i)

'''

pass

normally we use function - we except some statements - if we doesnot define the function - it will give a error - so we need to use pass in this scenario 
we use this when we are not sure what to with the block of code

we use pass - if we donot know what to mention

'''

continue & break - used in loops 
pass - used when we want to skip the block
