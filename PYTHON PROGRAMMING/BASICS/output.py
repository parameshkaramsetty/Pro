# for else
# we can use this in python

# in python we can use else - without any previous if

# in the same way we can use else after a for loop - if condition fails for every iteration - then after the loop we can use a else condition - to tell the seq. doesnot satisfy the condition
# instead of using else - for each if we can use else after the end of the loop 

'''

for else 
use this only when loop is having a condition 
if condition failes then pointer goes to the else block
it will only work when we have break - which means we tell the computer to not use else if we the condition is satisfied 
so we use break and there is no need to go to else block

ex :

for i in [1,2,4,5]:
    if i%3==0:
        print(i)
        break
else:
    print("not found")

'''
# for i in [1,2,4,5]:
#     if i%3==0:
#         print(i)
#         break
# else:
#     print("not found")

# output: 
# not found
