INTERPRETED 
OBJECT ORIENTED - AND - PROCEDURAL
HIGH LEVEL

BECAUSE OF THE WIDE AVAILABILITY OF MODULES

EASY TO LEARN

HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON :
python.org > DOWNLOAD > ADD PATH TO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
IDE 
IDLE


check version -> in cmd -> python --version

COMPUTER UNDERSTANDS 0's & 1's  - SO PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

ARITHMATIC OPERATIONS

// -> integer division

/ -> float division

() > ** > * / % > + - 

% -> GIVES REMAINDER

integer -> type - 2 , 4, 23 , 494
float -> 2.4
string -> '' , "" ,''' '''

functions -> builtin function & predefined function

print() -> builtin function

WE CAN USE \ -> TO PRINT UNUSED CHARACTERS THAT ARE NOT ALLOWED NORMALLY

print("\"") -> prints: "

WE CAN PLAY WITH STRINGS AND MULTIPLICATIONS
10 * 'paramesh'
it prints this 10 times

WE NEED TO USE r BEFORE THE STRING THAT CONTAINS ESCAPE CHARACTERS 
print(r"c:\users\navin\python")

VARIABLES :
THESE ARE USED TO PUT THE VALUE AND WE CAN NAME TO IT

x = 2 #assignment operation
x -> it is the name of the variable 
2 -> it is the value stored in x

IF WE DONOT ASSIGN A VARIABLE OR IF A VARIABLE IS NOT DEFINED THEN IT SHOWS A ERROR

TO GET THE OUTPUT OF THE PREVIOUS OPERATION -> USE UNDERSCORE( _ )

TO ADD STRINGS :
name = 'name '
name + 'rocks'
> namerocks

WE CAN GET 1st letter in name  -> name[0]

 n  a  m  e
 0  1  2  3
-4 -3 -2 -1

name[0] = 'n'
name[1:4] -> gives name[1] to name[4-1]
like wise for negative indexing
if we doesnot give upperbound then it goes to end of the array

ONCE VALUE IS ASSIGNED TO THE STRING => WE CANNOT CHANGE IT

TO GET THE LENGHT OF THE STRING
> len(name)

we can also use negative indexing as it starts from end of the array from -1

> we can also reverse the string by name[::-1]
here name[star:end:step_count]
name[start:end]
start -> included -> if not mentioned it will start from 0
end -> excluded  -> if not mentioned it will go upto len(name) 

Lists 
nums = [1,2,3,4] ->  we can store multiple types of data
we can access values 
nums[0] = 1
nums[-1] = 4


WE USE LOOPS - WHEN WE WANT TO REPEAT SAME THING MULTIPLE TIMES

continue & break - used in loops 
    CONTINUE - TO SKIP
    BREAK - TO EXIT FROM THE LOOP
pass - used when we want to skip the block
