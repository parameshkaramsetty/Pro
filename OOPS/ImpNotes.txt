OOPs

Object Oriented Programming system

Can be used by Java , Python , Go , C++ , C#

Concepts :
    Class
    Object
    Access Specifiers
    4 Pillars - Polymorphism , Inheritance , Encapsulation  , Abstraction


For each Concept write a program in Cpp , Java , Python

Encapsulation - uses Access Specifiers - data can be read/write only using getters or setters having certain logic
Example : Bank Example - Bank balance of a person can work using getters and setters methods only having a password or level of user

Inheritance - Inheriting the properties and methods from Base Class to Derived Class - can write the common method in base class and call them when required using Inheritance
Example : Parent to child relationship - child have own methods and inherits parent properties when required

Polymorphism - Many Forms - Overriding the method in base class  

Abstraction - Abstract Classes allow child classes to have its own implementation using abstract methods - it can have abstract and normal methods
