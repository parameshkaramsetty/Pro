OPERATIONS 
push() -> adds item into the stack 
IF THE STACK IS FULL IT SAYS OVERFLOW
pop() -> to remove item from stack
isEmpty() -> to check whether stack is empty or not - returns true when stack is empty else false
top() -> returns top most element of the stack
size() -> returns the size of the stack

push - while pushing we need to check for size of the stack - if the size of stack is full then it becomes OVERFLOW
pop - removes the topmost element in the stack - if the size of stack is null then it becomes underflow
