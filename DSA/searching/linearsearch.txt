we go with a loop from start to end and we keep on searching for every element

1 2 3 4 5 
i 
  i 
    i  
      i 
         i

    we take a iterator and keep on checking for each value in the ARRAY to search for the element is present or not

let 
a[] = { 1,78,23,47,81,99,56,61,90,32 };
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

key = 81
we check for every element using a loop 
    a[0]==key
    a[1]==key
    a[2]==key
    a[3]==key
    a[4]==key  --> it is true  -> then we can say that the element is there in the ARRAY

if the element is not found then we return -1( -ve indexing ) -> element is not present in the given ARRAY

time complexity : O(n)
