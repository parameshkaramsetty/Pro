It is a type of linear search
it is used to avoid out of bound comparisions

last element in the array is made the key -> assume that the key is in the last index of the array
we will make sure that key is in array by the above step
sentinal search - target value => added at the end of the array
no. of comparisions made - n+2
index will never be out of bounds of the array
time complexity is same as linear search but no. of comparisions are reduced in sentinal linear search
