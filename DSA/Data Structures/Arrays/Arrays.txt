ARRAY IS A COLLECTION OF SIMILAR DATA TYPES STORED AT CONTIGUOUS MEMORY ALLOCATIONS


STATIC MEMORY 
STORES MEMORY IN CONTIGUOUS MEMORY LOCATIONS
STORES SIMILAR TYPE OF DATA

OPERATIONS PERFORMED ON AN ARRAY
INITIALIZE
SEARCH
SORT
REVERSE
TRAVERSE
INSERT
DELETE

DECLARATION :
C AND C++ : data_type name_of_array[size] // can initialize when it is required
JAVA : 
    data_type[size] name_of_array; or  data_type name_of_array[size]
    int[10] a;
    int a[10];
    
    
int a[] = { 2,3,4,5,6};

C 
int a[size];

C++
int a[size];

PYTHON
THERE IS NO CONCEPT OF ARRAYS INSTEAD WE HAVE LISTS , TUPLES , SETS

JAVA
int[] a = new int[size]; or int a[] = {ELEMENTS_HERE};

IN EVERY LANGUAGE THE THING CHANGING IS THE DATA TYPE
THE CHANGING THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS : NAME , SIZE OF THE ARRAY

EXAMPLES OF DECLARATION OF ARRAYS
C AND C++:
int a[10];
char a[10];
float a[10];

WE CAN ALSO CREATE DYNAMIC ARRAYS IN C , C++ , JAVA , PYTHON
C - DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION
C++ - DMA , STL
JAVA - COLLECTIONS
PYTHON - DEFAULT - LISTS , ..

TYPES OF ARRAYS : N-D ARRAYS
WHERE N=1,2,3...

FOR N-D ARRAYS WE KEEP N(" [] ") AFTER THE NAME OF THE ARRAY AND GIVE THE SIZE OR ELSE WE CAN INITIALIZE IT DIRECTLY
int a[] -> for 1-d array
int a[][] -> for 2-d array
int a[][][]  -> for 3-d array

ARRAY =>   12 42 47 81 99
INDEX =>   0  1  2  3  4

IN EVERY LANGUAGE ARRAY INDEX STARTS FROM 0 ONLY - AND IT CAN BE CHANGED FROM 0 -> 1 ( AS IT IS REGULAR )

2-D ARRAYS  -> IT IS LIKE A MATRIX
    0  1  2  3
0   1  2  3  4
1   5  6  7  8
2   9  10 11 12
3   13 14 15 16

SUB-ARRAYS , SUB-SEQUENCE & SUBSETS IN ARRAYS :
    SUBARRAY - IT IS CONTINUOUS PART OF ARRAY , IT IS A ARRAY WHICH IS A PART OF ANOTHER ARRAY
               IN AN ARRAY OF SIZE - N THERE ARE N*(N+1)/2 NON-EMPTY SUBARRAYS
            [1, 2, 3, 4]   -  10 SUB ARRAYS - 4*5/2=10
            SUBARRAYS ARE  - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4, 1 2 , 2 3 , 3 4 , 1 2 3 , 2 3 4  , 1 2 3 4  = 10 (count)

    SUBSEQUENCE - A SUBSEQUENCE IS  A SEQUENCE THAT IS DERIVED FROM ANOTHER SEQUENCE BY REMOVING 0 OR MORE ELEMENTS WITHOUT CHANGING THE ORDER OF THE REMAINING ELEMENTS
                  THERE ARE 2^N - 1 SUBSEQUENCE'S FOR AN ARRAY OF SIZE N 
                  1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 1 2 , 1 3 , 1 4 , 2 3 , 2 4 , 3 4 , 1 2 3 , 1 2 4 , 1 3 4 , 2 3 4 , 1 2 3 4  => 15
    SUBSET - IF A SET ALL OF IT ELEMENTS IN ANOTHER SET THEN IT IS A SUBSET
             A = {1, 2,3,4} 
             B = {2,3}
             A IS SUBSET OF B
             SINCE ALL ELEMENTS IN B IS IN A


OPERATIONS ON ARRAYS
SINCE ARRAY IS STATIC IN ORDER TO PERFORM OPERATIONS LIKE INSERTING ELEMENTS THE ARRAY SIZE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ADD THE ARRAY
