TREES - USED IN A HIERARCHIAL PATTERN

STRUCTURE OF A TREE - LEAF BRANCH ROOT

BUT IN DATA STRUCTURES => ROOT NODE , BRANCHES , LEAF NODES(NO NODES AFTER THIS)

BINARY TREE - AT MAX. ONLY 2 CHILDREN(BINARY 0 & 1)

A HIERARCHIAL Data Structure with 0,1,2 Childs

Types
Full Binary Tree - If all the nodes are having 0 or 2 Child nodes
Complete Binary Tree - If all the levels are filled completely except the last level and last level should have left child or none
Perfect Binary Tree - If all the levels are completely filled with nodes
Balanced Binary Tree - If there are Log2(N) levels , N - No.of nodes
Degenerate Binary Tree - If the nodes are in the form of a Queue (Continuous Pattern)
